#Apache Wicket Groovy DSL Project

## Overview
Apache Wicket is great, and Groovy is also great. This project tries to combine the power of both. However, sometimes Apache Wicket code become damn verbose.
But with some little, but powerful Groovy DSL written, we can extend Wicket to simplify common tasks, and to delete over 30-40% of verbose code.
Versions used:
### 1. Apache Wicket 6.15.0
### 2. Groovy 2.3.1 (Yes, with Traits :)
